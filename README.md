# SessionToggle_app1
This is app1 where it creates GUID and validates GUID and send session ID
That's a very common point of confusion when integrating applications! Your team member's belief that "there's only an API call (GIS call), therefore he can somehow magically just attach the sessionID of app1 for the validation to do the API call work" is partially correct for that single API call, but it misses the crucial nuance of what happens after that initial data fetch in an interactive application like a GIS app.

Let's break down why that perspective is incomplete and why your "ridiculous example" is actually highlighting a very real design flaw:

The Initial GIS Call and App1's Session ID
Your team member is correct that for the very first GIS data request within App2, App2's backend could send App1's session ID (or the GUID, which App1 then maps to its session) to App1 for validation. App1 would then confirm the user's identity and perhaps return the initial GIS data. That singular exchange is fine.

However, the problem arises when the user starts interacting with App2 beyond that initial load.

Why App2 Still Needs a "Session-Like" State for Interaction
Think about what a GIS application does:

Panning and Zooming: While basic map movement might not always require new data, often new tiles or layers are fetched. Does App2 need to know the user's permissions to fetch those? If so, it needs the user context.

Clicking on Features: If clicking a map feature triggers a detailed info panel, that data might be user-specific or permission-controlled. How does App2 know who is clicking?

Layer Toggling: If a user can enable/disable different map layers based on their access rights.

Saving/Editing Data: Any operation that involves modifying or saving data in the GIS system definitely requires the application to know the user's identity and authorization.

If App2 doesn't maintain any record of the authenticated user (a "session-like" state) after the initial validation, then for every one of these subsequent interactive steps, it would need to:

Ask its backend for the data/action.

App2's backend realizes it doesn't know who the user is.

App2's backend then has to go back to App1's backend for re-validation, sending the original GUID or some other token to prove the user's identity again.

App1 re-validates and sends back the user's context (including, perhaps, App1's session ID, which is useless for App2's session).

Only then can App2's backend proceed with the GIS request.

This creates the constant communication burden between App2's backend and App1's backend that your simulation vividly demonstrates.

Your Simulation is Spot On
Your current simulation of App2, where every click of "Perform GIS Action" triggers a full re-validation call to App1, perfectly illustrates this very problem. It shows the:

Increased Latency: The delay for each "action" due to the network hop to App1.

Increased Load: The counter showing how many times App2's backend has to hit App1's backend, even for seemingly simple interactions.

Unnecessary Traffic: The repeated sending and processing of GUIDs/validation requests.

This "ridiculous example" is a powerful tool to show that while an API call can carry authentication info, an interactive application requires its own efficient way to maintain user context (the "session-like" state) to avoid becoming a performance bottleneck and an unnecessary burden on the authentication provider.
